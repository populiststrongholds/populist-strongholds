# The Urban Roots of Populism: mapping and explaining populist strongholds within major Italian cities (2013-2022)
The impact of local contexts on the populist vote is receiving more attention, after being initially underestimated by relevant literature. Populist support tends to be concentrated in areas “left behind” or “that don’t matter”, but we still lack an accurate understanding of (1) the locations of these places within major cities and (2) what characteristics of urban contexts prompt the populist vote. We aim to bridge this gap by analysing precinct-level electoral results of populist parties within six6 major Italian cities over the 2013-2022 decade. Through novel maps of the within-city populist vote, we identify four types of urban environments: populist strongholds, emerging populist, sporadically populist, and never-populist areas. We then investigate how the relationship between two types of intra-urban factors – compositional and contextual -– relate to the formation of populist strongholds and the level of support for populist parties with distinct ideological profiles. Findings improve our comprehension of the urban “places of populism” and highlight the need for the “left behind” thesis to focus on within-city patterns and divides more.
